"""
The recording window and `film init` agree on which picture is which.

The booth is about to show the photographs one at a time while somebody
narrates them. If it shows them in one order and `init` builds the film
in another, the words said over picture 2 end up under picture 3, and
nothing on screen would say why.

So there is one rule, in slides (scaffold until 2026-10-05), and both use it:

  the order of the pictures -- numbered files first by their number,
  then openers, the rest, closers, exactly as `init` lays out a film;
  which picture goes with which paragraph -- in order, unless the
  paragraph names one with `[3]` or `[3_name.png]`, and the last
  picture again when the paragraphs run over.

`film record` asks slides and hands the booth the finished list.

Files on disk for the ordering; nothing is decoded.
