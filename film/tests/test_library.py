"""
The shelf -- the music and the cover pictures that every film shares.

The promise being tested is a small one and it is the whole point: you
put a track in one folder, once, and every film you make from then on
has music without anybody typing anything. So the rules that matter are
about precedence (this film's own folder always wins) and about failing
quietly (an empty shelf, a missing shelf, a shelf full of rubbish -- none
of these may stop a film).
