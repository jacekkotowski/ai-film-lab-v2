"""
`film init` cuts a narration into one piece per picture.

Before this, a project of photographs with a voiceover got `audio:` --
one track laid flat under the whole film -- and the pictures stretched
evenly to cover it. On `projects/test_story` that was 23.3 / 19.1 /
19.1 seconds against a narration whose sentences fall at 1.8, 19.7,
30.2, 40.9 and 54.7. Nothing lined up, and there was nothing in
film.yaml to line up BY.

So: when there are photographs and a narration and no script, the
narration is cut at its longest pauses, one piece per picture, and each
picture becomes a slide holding its own words. Exactly what already
happens to a talking take, which is cut at its pauses into one shot per
piece -- same constants, same breath either side of the cut.

The pauses measured on test_story's own 59.5s narration, for the
numbers used below: the three longest are 34.45-37.40, 7.70-9.55 and
10.25-12.20. Three pictures means two cuts, at the longest two.

Everything here works off a pause list handed in. Nothing decodes
audio.
