"""
When media/ holds more than one narration, the newest is the one used.

Found on 2026-09-18. Jacek recorded test_story again, pressing Next
between the pictures, and ran `go --rewrite`. The film came back built
from the PREVIOUS day's take: `voiceover_20260917-105656.wav` sorted
before `voiceover_20260918-103350.wav`, and both `scaffold.build` and
`voice.voice_sources` took the first file in alphabetical order. Today's
recording and the places he pressed Next were saved and never used.

Recording again is how anybody says "not that one, this one". So: the
file most recently written wins, and a name that starts `voiceover`
beats one that does not, as it always has. Both callers ask the same
function, so the soundtrack and the captions can never pick different
takes.

The clock is handed in; nothing here reads a real file's time.
