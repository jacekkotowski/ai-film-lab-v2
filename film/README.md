# AI Film Lab

Drop photographs and clips in a folder. Get a cinematic sequence out —
camera movement, music, captions from your own talking. It runs on your
own computer: nothing is uploaded, no account, no internet needed once
it's installed.

## Get it running (Windows)

1. Above, click **Code → Download ZIP**, then unzip it wherever you
   like. (`git clone` works too, if you'd rather.)
2. Double-click **`FILM.bat`**. The very first time, if it can't find
   the two free programs it needs, it prints two lines to paste into
   PowerShell — paste them, close the window, and double-click
   `FILM.bat` again. That only happens once.
3. It asks for a name, opens a folder for your photos and clips, and
   walks you through everything from there — one question at a time,
   telling you the next step as it goes.

Everything all three stages need (slides, film, fly, and Claude's search)
is listed in one place: the repo's `docs/SETUP.md`.

**[Read HOW_TO_USE.md](HOW_TO_USE.md)** for the full walkthrough. It
assumes nothing, and it's the manual for everything below this point too.

**[Read WHAT_IT_DOES.md](WHAT_IT_DOES.md)** if you'd rather know what the
program does to your pictures and your sound before you install it.

## Set up once, then never again

```powershell
uv run film library
```

One folder holds the music and the two thumbnail pictures — one wide,
one tall — that **every** film uses. Fill it in once and no film ever
asks you for either again: the music is cut to length and ducked under
your voice, and `film final` prints the film's name on whichever
thumbnail picture matches its shape. A film with its own `music\` or
`cover\` folder overrides it.

## The three ways in, in order of effort

**Double-click `FILM.bat`.** It asks what you want, does it, and tells
you what is next. No terminal, no commands.

**Type `uv run film`.** The same thing, in a terminal — the RStudio
Terminal pane does fine. Every command it runs, it prints first, so you
learn them by using it.

**Type `claude`.** For the parts that need taste rather than steps:
*"shot 2 is too long and the camera move is too aggressive."* The
working agreement in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is what keeps it editing
the film instead of rewriting the machine.
[docs/HOW_CLAUDE_IS_SET_UP.md](docs/HOW_CLAUDE_IS_SET_UP.md) explains
the whole set-up — rulebooks, skills, hooks, decision records — as an
example you can copy.

## What it is

The film is a **document** — `film.yaml` — not a project file. You can
read it, diff it, and hand it to anyone:

```yaml
  - id: s04
    src: media/harbour.jpg
    duration: 6.0
    move: push_in
    focus: [0.42, 0.38]
    note: "held long -- this is the one that has to land"
```

Everything else is the machine that renders it. Four dependencies:
numpy, opencv, pillow, pyyaml. Start with [ffilm/spec.py](ffilm/spec.py)
— it says what a film *is*, and the rest follows from it.

Every render commits your `film.yaml` if it changed, so any version you
have ever watched can be brought back:

```powershell
uv run film undo -p my_movie
```

## Into 3D

`film final` also writes `out\final.timeline.json` beside the film: where
every shot starts and ends, frame by frame, and what it is for — title,
intro, slide, closing. Other tools can pick the film up from there
without guessing.

The first one is **[ai-3d-studio](https://github.com/jacekkotowski/ai-3d-studio)**.
It turns the finished film into a Prezi-style flight in Blender: every
part of the film on its own screen around the title, the camera diving
into each one as it plays, and back to the middle for your closing.
Parts light up as the story reaches them.

**To fly a finished film** (offline, no Claude needed):
1. Install what it needs once: Blender, Python and ffmpeg (the repo's
   `docs/SETUP.md`, section 4).
2. Drag `out\final.mp4` onto the repo's `FLY.bat`. It picks up
   `final.timeline.json` from beside the mp4 by itself, so keep the two
   together. Dragging the `out` folder or the film's folder works too.
3. It renders stills for you to check, then asks: `d` for a draft, `v`
   for the full video. The result is `fly\out\flight_film.mp4` in the
   film's own folder.
