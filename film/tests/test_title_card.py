"""
The opening card -- the film's name over the thumbnail picture, held for
four seconds before anybody speaks.

It is DERIVED, and that is the whole risk in it. film.yaml points at a
file in analysis/, and analysis/ is the folder that gets deleted: it is
regenerable by design, it is in .gitignore, and `film pack` leaves it
behind. A film that will not open because its own opening shot has been
tidied away would be the worst kind of bug -- so most of what is below
is about the card coming back on its own.
