"""
Every way of recording stays on the menu.

The guide works out the next step from what is on disk, which means a
step disappears the moment the thing it produces exists. That is right
for the BEST step and wrong for the alternatives, because it makes the
whole footage path one-way: each recording is offered once, and once
you have done it -- or skipped it by pressing ENTER -- there is no
screen anywhere that offers it again.

Measured on 2026-09-20, walking a scratch project through every stage:

    media/              ENTER drag photos in  | [2] say it to the camera
    photos only         ENTER record --voice  | go | ingest
    intro + photos      ENTER record --voice  | go | ingest
    + narration         ENTER go | ingest     | [3] closing words
    + closing           ENTER go | ingest

Two holes in that. With photos in and no narration yet there is no way
to talk to the camera at all -- which is what Jacek hit: he pressed
ENTER meaning to record an intro, got the narration window, and no
later screen would take him back. And once a narration exists, saying
it again is never offered, although `kinds.pick_narration` has taken
the newest one since 2026-09-18 and re-recording is exactly how anybody
says "not that one, this one".

So the doors are appended to every menu that does not already hold
them, last, after the alternatives that are actually next.
