# How Claude is set up in this repo

This repo is also a worked example of **programming with an AI assistant**.
This page explains the set-up: what each piece is, when Claude reads it,
and how to decide where a new piece of knowledge belongs.

Nothing here is specific to films. Copy the shape.

## The idea in one picture

An instruction can be *said*, or it can be *made true*. The further down
this ladder a rule sits, the less it depends on the model remembering it:

```
  said          CLAUDE.md             "Edit film.yaml, not ffilm/"
    │           nested CLAUDE.md      "Faces hold longer than landscapes"
    │           skills                "An edit pass goes: re-read, split notes, …"
    │           decision records      "Parallel rendering: measured, worthless"
    │           tests                 "A caption stops where the next one starts"
    ▼           hooks                 "media/ cannot be written. Full stop."
  made true
```

**The rule of thumb:** begin a rule as a sentence. If it ever gets broken,
move it one step down.

- A mistake that recurs goes into a skill.
- A mistake that must never happen again becomes a test or a hook.

"Never touch the originals" began in CLAUDE.md. It is now a hook, because
"almost always" isn't good enough for someone's only copy of their
photographs.

## The pieces

| Piece | File(s) | When Claude reads it | What belongs there |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Root agreement** | `CLAUDE.md` | every session, always | who you are being, the one rule, pointers. Keep it short: it costs context on every turn |
| **Nested rulebooks** | `projects/CLAUDE.md`, `ffilm/CLAUDE.md` | only when Claude works in that folder | rules for one *role*: editor or developer |
| **Skills** | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | the one-line `description` always; the body only when the skill is used | a *procedure*: numbered steps, a why for each, a "done when" |
| **Hooks** | `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/hooks/*.py` | never read, **executed** on events | anything that must happen every time, or must never happen |
| **Permissions** | `.claude/settings.json` → `permissions` | enforced by Claude Code | which commands run without asking |
| **Decision records** | `docs/decisions/` | when a rulebook or skill points there | a question that cost real time, the numbers, the answer |
| **Docstrings** | top of each `ffilm/*.py` | when Claude opens that file | what the module *is* and why it is shaped that way |
| **Tests** | `tests/test_<a sentence>.py` | when run | a behaviour that broke once and must not break again |
| **Personal memory** | `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` | by that user's Claude only | facts about *one person or one machine*. Not shared, so not project knowledge |

### Why skills are per *workflow*, not per *module*

The tempting design is one skill per file: an `audio` skill, a `render`
skill. That duplicates the docstrings, and the two drift apart.

A skill answers "**how do I do this job**", and the jobs here cut across
modules: making a first cut touches `ingest`, `scaffold`, `moves` and
`render`. What a module *is* belongs in its docstring, next to the code
it describes.

| Skill | The job | Who starts it |
|---|---|---|
| `new-film` | media → first peek | Claude or `/new-film` |
| `edit-pass` | notes → small edits → render | Claude or `/edit-pass` |
| `investigate` | measure a fault before explaining it | Claude or `/investigate` |
| `change-the-machine` | test first, then code, then commit | Claude or `/change-the-machine` |
| `ship` | the slow final render | **only** `/ship` (`disable-model-invocation: true`) |
| `fit-to-length` | cut a film to a length (a Short: 3:00) by dropping what is said twice | Claude or `/fit-to-length` |
| `write-to-fit` | notes + photos → intro, one paragraph per picture, closing, inside a word budget | Claude or `/write-to-fit` |
| `status` | one screen: recorded, edit, current vs stale renders, next step. Read only | Claude or `/status` |
| `fix-captions` | captions the transcriber could not time, placed on the measured speech | Claude or `/fix-captions` |

### Growing a new skill

Skills will multiply as the project grows. **`fit-to-length` is the
model to copy**, and `docs/decisions/0009-how-a-skill-is-born.md` says
why. In short:

1. Do the job once, for real, in a session.
2. Write the skill the same day, with that case's numbers in it.
3. Give it the same parts:
   - a `description` holding the user's own trigger words;
   - "why the machine alone can't";
   - "done first on…";
   - numbered steps: machine first → measure → propose → wait for "go" → edit → check → peek;
   - a `## Never` list;
   - one row in root `CLAUDE.md`.

### Why two rulebooks

The same person asks for two different kinds of work:

- **Editor**: "shot 3 drags". The right answer changes a number in a YAML file.
- **Developer**: "the render is slow". The right answer may change Python.

The most common failure was answering an editor request as a developer:
rewriting `render.py` to fix a pacing note. Separate rulebooks, loaded by
folder, keep each role's context small and its rules sharp.

## Where does a new piece of knowledge go?

```
Is it about ONE person or ONE machine?          → personal memory
Must it happen EVERY time, with no exceptions?  → hook
Did it break once, and is it checkable in code? → test
Is it "we tried X, here are the numbers"?       → docs/decisions/
Is it a sequence of steps for a recurring job?  → skill
Does it apply to one role or one folder?        → nested CLAUDE.md
Does every session need it, whatever the task?  → root CLAUDE.md  (rarely)
Is it what a module is or does?                 → that module's docstring
```

## Trying it

- **Type `/`** in Claude Code to see the skills; `/ship` starts the final render.
- **See the guard work:** ask Claude to "write a note into
  `projects/<film>/media/`". It will be refused, with the reason.
- **See the check work:** ask for any edit to a `film.yaml`. The
  `film check` output arrives with the edit.
- **Test a hook by hand.** They are plain Python reading JSON from stdin:
  ```powershell
  echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"projects/x/media/a.jpg"}}' | python .claude/hooks/guard_media.py
  ```
- **Switch hooks off** for a session: `/hooks` in an interactive `claude` terminal.

## What this set-up deliberately does not have

- **No framework.** No agents calling agents. Knowledge lives in plain
  files that a person reads the same way Claude does.
- **MCP servers and a vector index are allowed** (Jacek, 2026-09-24).
  The earlier "no MCP servers, no vector database" was Claude's reading
  of "keep it lean", never his rule. "Lean" is about the film's code and
  its four packages, not about the tools Claude uses. The index is qmd
  (`docs/tech/qmd.md`). It searches the plain files and never replaces
  them: a file is still the one home of each fact.
- **No duplicated knowledge.** Each fact has one home, and the other
  places point to it. A map copied into three files is wrong in two of them
  within a month.
- **No rule without a reason.** Every rule says *why*. A model, like a
  new colleague, applies a rule well only when it knows what the rule
  protects.
