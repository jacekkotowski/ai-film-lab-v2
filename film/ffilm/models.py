"""
models.py  --  the model files, fetched once, checked, kept in models/.

Two small files that are other people's and are never committed: one
finds you in the frame (bokeh), one takes the room out from under your
voice. They live in the toolkit's own `models/` folder, where you can
see them, and nowhere else -- not in a hidden cache in your user folder.

On a new computer nothing has to be done by hand. The first time a
model is needed it is downloaded, its SHA-256 is checked against the
number written here, and only then is it put in models/. `film models`
does the same for all of them at once, and `film doctor` says which
are there. Without a network the film still renders: the look or the
cleaning that needs the missing model is left out, and it says so.

Adding a model is one entry in CATALOGUE and one row in models/README.md;
a test keeps the two in agreement.

FFILM_MODELS moves the folder somewhere else.
