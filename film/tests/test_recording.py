"""
Recording from a camera and a microphone.

The samples below are real output from a real machine -- a Polish
Windows laptop with an EasyCamera, a Realtek microphone whose name
contains a letter that is not in ASCII, and OBS installed but shut.
Every one of those is a thing that has broken this kind of code before,
which is why they are here rather than a tidy invented example.

None of this opens a device. It is parsing and flag-building only.
