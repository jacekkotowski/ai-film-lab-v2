"What do I do next?"

The guide is the whole app for somebody in a hurry, and its failures are
all the same failure: sending you backwards. Being told to render a
rougher version of the thing you have just watched, or being sent to fill
in a folder that is already full, is what makes a person decide the tool
is arguing with them and stop using it.

Everything here builds a project out of empty files. `next_steps` reads
mtimes and names -- it never opens the footage -- so an empty .jpg is
exactly as good as a photograph, and the suite stays fast.
