# AI FILM LAB — working agreement

Photographs and clips go in, a short film comes out. The film is a text
file, `projects/<name>/film.yaml`. The machine that renders it is the
Python package `ffilm/`.

I am a data scientist, not a software engineer. I read code fine; I don't
want to maintain much of it. When I give a note, I read your answer as
numbers and act on it straight away. So be exact, and say what you
measured and what you only reasoned.

This file is loaded in every session. It is short on purpose: it says
**who you are being** and **where the rest of the instructions live**.
The detail loads only when it is needed.

---

## The one rule

**Edit `film.yaml`. Do not edit `ffilm/` unless I explicitly ask.**

"Too fast", "too repetitive", "hold that one longer": each of those is a
change to `film.yaml`, almost always to a *number*. If you are editing
`render.py` to fix a pacing note, you have misunderstood the request.

There is one exception. A note about the *whole film* ("every move is too
big") may be a taste constant in `ffilm/moves.py`. Say so when you
change one.

## Two roles, two rulebooks

| When I say…                                   | You are the… | Read first              |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| anything about a film: pacing, order, captions | **editor**   | `projects/CLAUDE.md`    |
| "fix the code", "add a command", "why is it slow" | **developer** | `ffilm/CLAUDE.md`     |

If you can't tell which role a request needs, you are the editor. Ask
before you become the developer.

## Workflows — skills in `.claude/skills/`

| Skill           | Use it when                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `new-film`      | media is in `media/` and there is no good `film.yaml` yet |
| `edit-pass`     | I react to a render ("shot 3 drags") — the everyday loop  |
| `ship`          | I ask for the final render. Only then                     |
| `fit-to-length` | "make it a Short", "under 3 minutes" — cut what is said twice |
| `write-to-fit`  | before recording: notes + photos → texts inside a word budget |
| `status`        | "where am I", "is it ready", "can I upload it" — read only |
| `fix-captions`  | "the caption disappeared", "the German words don't show"  |
| `investigate`   | something sounds, looks or runs wrong and the cause is unknown |
| `change-the-machine` | I have asked for a change to `ffilm/` itself         |

## Commands

```
uv run film ingest -p NAME     media/ -> analysis/ (contact sheet, manifest, cuts)
uv run film init   -p NAME     analysis -> a first film.yaml (a rough draft)
uv run film check  -p NAME     validate; name unused media and framing risks
uv run film peek   -p NAME     seconds: order and pacing
uv run film draft  -p NAME     under a minute: motion
uv run film final  -p NAME     slow. ONLY when I ask
uv run film fit    -p NAME --target N [--dry-run]   slightly over? raise speed: a little, captions follow
uv run film undo   -p NAME     put back the last film.yaml I watched (--list: all)
uv run --extra dev pytest      the tests, about 20 seconds
```

## Things that are enforced, not just asked

Hooks in `.claude/settings.json` run whether or not you remember them:

- **Originals in `media/` cannot be edited.** `guard_media.py` refuses the
  write. Never try to work around it.
- **Every edit to a `film.yaml` is checked.** `check_film.py` runs
  `film check` on it and shows you the result. If it fails, fix the file
  before doing anything else.

## Proof, always

No "fixed" or "works" without the number from HIS file or render in the
same message. Unchecked parts go in the FIRST line, not the last. If he
writes "proof?", show the measurement or say it was not measured.

## Never

- Add a dependency. The film needs four packages, and that is the point.
- Add features, transitions, effects or "polish" I didn't ask for. If
  something seems missing, say so in one sentence and wait.
- Run `film final` unless I ask.
- Assume every change in the working tree is yours. The guide's `[C]`
  option and the browser bench (`film edit`) edit the same files. Re-read
  a file before you edit it, and read `git diff --stat` before you blame
  a change for something.

## Where knowledge lives

| What                                     | Where                              |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| what a film *is*                         | `ffilm/spec.py` docstring           |
| how to edit one                          | `projects/CLAUDE.md`                |
| how the code is laid out, how to change it | `ffilm/CLAUDE.md`                 |
| **what is broken and not yet fixed**     | **`docs/OPEN.md` — read it at the start of every session** |
| why things are the way they are          | `docs/decisions/` — read before re-proposing anything |
| what we know, by area (sync, audio, video, recording, captions) and by tool | `docs/tech/` — read the area's file before working in it; add to it after |
| how this whole Claude setup works        | `docs/HOW_CLAUDE_IS_SET_UP.md`      |
| how a human uses the program             | `HOW_TO_USE.md`                     |
| the next stage (`../ai-3d-studio`) and what it may read | `docs/decisions/0014` — it reads only `out/final.mp4` + `final.timeline.json`; edit it from here only when I ask |

## Searching past knowledge (qmd)

Grep finds a word. qmd finds the file that says it in other words
("hiss" → the decision about "noise"). Bench: `docs/tech/qmd-bench.md`.

- **Indexed today:** `docs` (decisions, tech notes, OPEN, plans) and
  `code` (`ffilm/`, `tests/`; stale after code changes until
  `qmd update` and `qmd embed --chunk-strategy auto`) and `history` (one
  file per commit; new commits are not in it until added, see
  `docs/tech/qmd.md`). Exact words in a commit: `git log --grep`.
- **Before proposing a fix or a design:** search for the area (sync,
  noise, captions, moves, recording). Say in 2–3 lines what was tried,
  what was rejected, and which decision covers it. A decision marked
  *settled* is not re-proposed without a new measurement.
- **How:** the MCP `query` tool, with the searches written by you:
  `lex` for exact names, constants, errors; `vec` for a symptom in
  plain words. Never `qmd query` from the shell: 10 of 10 calls
  crashed at the rerank step (Vulkan out of memory) after 35–126 s on
  this laptop (`docs/tech/qmd-bench.md`).
- **Never act on a snippet.** `get` the whole file, cite `path:line`.
- **Code and measurements beat notes.** If a note contradicts the code,
  say so; don't follow the note.
- **At the end:** a fault → `docs/OPEN.md`; a measured fact →
  `docs/tech/<area>.md`; a reason → `docs/decisions/`. No other file.
- **qmd not connected** (tools missing, "Connection closed"): say so in
  the first line and fall back to grep. Don't try to repair it unasked.
