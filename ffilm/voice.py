"""
voice.py  --  turn a spoken track into captions with real timestamps.

    uv run film caption -p my_movie

Runs entirely on your machine. Nothing is uploaded, no account, no
internet needed after the model downloads once. Uses faster-whisper
(CTranslate2), which is several times quicker than the reference
Whisper on a CPU-only laptop and needs no GPU.

What this solves: writing `at:`/`dur:` for captions by hand means
guessing when you said a line and re-rendering to check. This listens
to what you actually said and writes the timing for you. You keep only
the judgment call a machine cannot make -- which lines are worth
putting on screen, and which shot each one belongs to.

The model downloads once (about 460 MB for the default 'small' size) and
is cached by faster-whisper itself -- nothing this toolkit manages.
