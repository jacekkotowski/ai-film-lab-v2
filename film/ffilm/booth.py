"""
booth.py  --  the one window. Paste, record, again, done.

Written for the worst moment it will ever be used in: somebody who is
upset, who has something they need to say now, and who has no attention
left over for a tool. So the whole thing is one window that opens ready
for your words, and closes when you are finished. No folder to find, no
file to make, no second thing to run.

    paste  ->  Ctrl+Enter  ->  talk  ->  SPACE  ->  again, or done

Four screens, one window, in that order. The words you paste are saved
to script.txt on the way past, so nothing you typed is ever lost --
including when you close the window and walk away.

Three worries answered while recording, because a person talking to a
laptop cannot check any of them afterwards:

    am I in shot?           a small self-view
    is it hearing me?       a bar that moves when you speak
    what was I going to say? the script, scrolling

None of that is a second camera. DirectShow hands a webcam to one
program at a time, so a preview that opened the camera itself would
fight the recording. The SAME ffmpeg that writes the file also sends a
small copy of the picture down a pipe and a loudness reading down its
log, and this window draws what arrives. One camera, one process.

No new dependency: tkinter ships with Python and Pillow was already
here. Where tkinter is missing, `available()` says so and recording
falls back to the plain terminal version, unchanged.
