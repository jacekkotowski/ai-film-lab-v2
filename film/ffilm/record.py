"""
record.py  --  talk to your camera, get a file in media/.

The point is to not need OBS for the ordinary case: sit down, say the
thing, stop, and have it already be part of the film. So:

    uv run film record

with no arguments, on a machine this has never run on, has to work. That
means nothing here may assume anything about the hardware. Devices are
discovered at runtime, the capture mode is negotiated from what the
camera says it can do, and the choice is remembered per machine -- not
per project, and never in git, because the next machine has a different
camera and a differently-named microphone.

Recording is the only interactive, long-running command in a toolkit
that is otherwise batch. It is deliberately kept dumb: capture honest
h264+aac into media/ and stop. Everything else -- trimming the silence
at the top, the 1.2x, the tone on the voice -- is a decision recorded in
film.yaml, where you can see it and change it. Nothing is baked into
the file on disk, because media/ is originals and originals are the one
thing you cannot get back.

Windows only for now, via DirectShow. macOS (avfoundation) and Linux
(v4l2) are each about five lines, but untested code that claims to work
is worse than an honest refusal, so they say so instead.
