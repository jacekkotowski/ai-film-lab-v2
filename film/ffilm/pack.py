"""
pack.py  --  a zip you can carry to another computer.

Almost nothing here is clever, and that is the point. The toolkit is
about 1.4 MB of text; everything heavy is either regenerable or is your
own footage. So a portable copy is: the text, your originals if you ask
for them, and a SETUP.bat that installs the two programs Windows does
not come with.

What it deliberately leaves out, and why:

  .venv/        388 MB of absolute paths baked in at build time. Useless
                on any other machine; `uv sync` rebuilds it in a minute.
  out/          every render you have ever made. The largest thing in the
                folder by far, and all of it comes back from film.yaml.
  analysis/     proxies and thumbnails. `film ingest` rebuilds them.
  .devices.json which camera THIS laptop has. The next one has another.
  .git/         history, kept out of a handoff on purpose -- see below.

Not an offline installer. It does not vendor wheels or ship ffmpeg.exe:
that would be half a gigabyte, locked to one Windows and one Python, and
it would rot quietly until the day you needed it. Two winget lines are
better than a bundle that expires.

1. Double-click SETUP.bat. It installs the two programs Windows does not
   come with (uv and ffmpeg) and fetches the four packages the film
   needs. It may tell you to close the window and run it again -- that is
   normal, and it only happens once.

2. Double-click FILM.bat. That is the whole thing from then on.

HOW_TO_USE.md is the long version if anything goes sideways.

What is NOT in this zip, on purpose:

  the renders (out/)        they come back from film.yaml
  the analysis (analysis/)  `film ingest` rebuilds it
  the installed packages    `uv sync` fetches them, matched exactly to
                            uv.lock so this computer behaves like the
                            one the zip came from

If a project came along, its originals are in projects/<name>/media and
are the one thing here that cannot be made again. Back those up the way
you back up photographs.
