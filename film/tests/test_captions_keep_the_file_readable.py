"""
Captions go INTO film.yaml without taking the rest of it with them.

This used to be `yaml.safe_load` then `yaml.safe_dump`, which is correct
YAML and deletes every comment in the file, because comments are not
data. `film go` captions on its own, so the explanatory header that
`film init` writes -- the one that says what every number means -- was
gone before anybody had opened the file once. Six of the eight films on
the machine this was written on had no comments left in them at all.

Every test here is one thing that must survive being captioned.
