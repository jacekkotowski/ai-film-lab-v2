# models/ — fetched once, checked, never committed

The model files the toolkit needs live here, in this visible folder, and
nowhere else. Git ignores everything in this folder except this README,
and `film pack` carries only this README.

**Nothing has to be done by hand on a new computer.** The first time a
film needs a model, it is downloaded, its SHA-256 is checked against the
number below, and only then is it saved here. To fetch them all up front:

```
uv run film models
```

`uv run film doctor` says which are here. Without a network a film still
renders: the bokeh or the voice cleaning that needs the missing file is
left out, and the render says so.

The list that actually runs is `CATALOGUE` in `ffilm/models.py`; a test
checks that this table agrees with it.

## Measured, not used

These were downloaded to compare, and nothing in `ffilm/` uses them. They
are not fetched on a new computer.
