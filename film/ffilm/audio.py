"""
audio.py  --  build the film's soundtrack.

Three things can make sound, and all three need to end up in the file:

  1. Speech recorded IN your video clips. This is the one that was
     being silently thrown away before -- you talk to camera, and the
     old code muxed only a global track, so your voice vanished.
     Each video shot's audio is cut to its in/out segment and placed
     at that shot's position on the finished timeline.

  2. A narration track (`audio:`), if you recorded one separately.

  3. A music bed (`music:`, or just drop a file in the project's
     music/ folder). Trimmed -- or looped -- to the film's exact
     length, faded in and out, and held at `music_volume` (0.6 by
     default) -- and ducked out of the way while anyone is talking,
     which is what lets it be that loud in the gaps.

Built as a second pass with one ffmpeg call after the video is
rendered. That is deliberate: the video's true length is known by
then, so the music can be cut to it exactly, and nothing gets
truncated by `-shortest` guessing wrong.

# ffmpeg's speech normaliser: follow the peaks of the voice and expand it
# up towards a target. p=0.7 leaves headroom for the music underneath;
# r keeps the rise gentle enough not to breathe.
#
# e was 25, and 25 is what put a waterfall between the sentences.
# Expansion does not know what speech is -- it lifts whatever is quiet,
# and between two sentences the only quiet thing is the room. Measured on
# a real take, the same one second of room tone, everything else equal:
#
#     raw                                     -45.3 dB
#     through e=25                            -17.5 dB     +27.8
#     the voice on that take                  -15.0 dB
#
# The room was being brought to within 2.5dB of the person talking. e=6
# is still three times ffmpeg's own default, still rescues a voice
# recorded too quietly, and leaves the gaps at -66dB. The voice itself
# measures the same either way -- -16.3dB before and after, so this costs
# nothing where it matters.
# e was 6, and before that 25. Both were wrong in the same way: the
# expander was being asked to be the thing that RESCUES a quiet take, and
# an expander cannot do that without also lifting the room. It gives its
# gain to whatever is quiet, and between two words the quiet thing is the
# room. Measured on a real take, one second of room tone against the
# voice on the same take:
#
#     e=6, no measured gain     room -63.8   voice -17.1   SNR 46.7
#     take measured first, e=2  room -71.9   voice -18.6   SNR 53.3
#
# 6.6dB of background, gone, for 1.5dB of level -- which loudnorm puts
# back at the end anyway. The rescue is `take_gain_db` below: a flat gain
# that lifts the voice and the room together and so cannot change the
# ratio between them. What is left for the expander is what it is
# actually for -- the difference between a sentence you leaned into and
# one you tailed off -- and e=2 is enough for that.
SPEECH_NORM = "speechnorm=p=0.7:e=2:r=0.0003:l=1"

# Before the expansion: take the hiss out, so there is less of it to
# lift. Broadband, gentle, and it does not touch the voice.
#
# `nf` tells afftdn where the noise floor is, and it is ABSOLUTE dBFS --
# so a fixed number is only right for a take recorded at the level it was
# tuned for. It used to be -25: the loud end of the filter's own range
# (-80..-20), and 25dB hotter than ffmpeg's own default. On a take
# peaking near 0dBFS that is survivable. On a quiet one it is not.
# Consonants are broadband and low-energy, so to a spectral denoiser
# that has been told the room sits at -25dB, an `s` IS the room.
#
# Measured on two of my own takes -- sibilance (4-10kHz, relative to the
# whole signal) against not denoising at all:
#
#                     take at -17dBFS peak     take at 0dBFS peak
#                     (floor -56, SNR 17)      (floor -38, SNR 23)
#     nf=-25                -9.2 dB                  -1.1 dB
#     nf=-50                -0.5 dB                   0.0 dB
#     nf=-50:tn=1           -0.2 dB                   0.0 dB
#
# That 9.2dB is entirely consonants, and it is why a quiet take can come
# back sounding like the plosives were edited out. They were.
#
# `tn=1` is what makes one setting serve every take: afftdn tracks the
# noise floor as it goes instead of trusting the number. It also adapts
# in the useful direction -- on the quieter take, the one with the WORSE
# signal-to-noise ratio, it removed 11.7dB of hiss; on the cleaner one,
# 2.7dB. `nf` stays at ffmpeg's default as the estimate it starts from.
#
# Not `tr=1` (track residual). It denoises harder -- 11.6dB on the loud
# take -- and starts costing consonants again on the quiet one (-2.8dB).
#
# Caveat worth knowing: tracking needs a little audio to converge, and
# `speech_chain` trims per shot. A shot starting mid-word gives it no
# room tone to learn from, so it does less. Less is the safe direction.
# nf is ABSOLUTE dBFS, and that used to be the whole problem: the right
# number depends on how loud the take was, and nothing knew. It is safe
# now for a reason that is worth saying plainly -- the denoiser runs
# AFTER `take_gain_db` has brought the take to LEVEL_TARGET_LUFS, so
# every take reaching it is at the same level, and one number is finally
# right for all of them. Measured across takes attenuated 0/-12/-20/-28
# dB, the chain now comes out identical: voice -18.6, room -71.9,
# sibilance -15.0 relative, every time.
#
# -45 rather than -50 because it removes about 4dB more and costs 0.1dB
# of sibilance. `tn=1` stays: it tracks the floor as it goes, so a take
# recorded in a different room still lands somewhere sensible.

# BEFORE it stops the expander seeing the room at all -- and that is new,
# because for a long time the note here said a gate placed first "measured
# EXACTLY no change". That was true and is no longer, and the reason is
# worth keeping: a gate can only be placed where the level is known, and
# until `take_gain_db` existed the level was whatever the microphone
# happened to do. The threshold was a constant sitting in the middle of
# the room's own scatter, so it closed on about half the pauses.

# Not skipping ahead: `-ss` before `-i`, tried, measured, and rejected

# decodes each one from the top, so it looks like obvious waste. On one
# real ten-shot film the audio decoded to build one soundtrack is 1599
# seconds where 337 would do -- the ducking sidechain builds the same
# pieces a second time, so a 157 second take is walked from the start
# eighteen times to reach nine windows scattered through it. A 4.7x
# saving, apparently, for one flag.
#
# It is worth 0.8%. Measured, same film, same machine, everything else
# identical:
#
#     everything as it is now                     17.9s
#     with -ss before every -i                    17.7s
#     with no ducking (half the filter chains)    11.7s   -34.7%
#     with speech_lift off (no denoise/norm/gate) 14.3s   -20.1%
#     with loudnorm off                            9.0s   -49.6%
#
# The decode was never the cost. Half the time is loudnorm and most of
# the rest is the voice chain, run twice. Skipping 80% of the decoding
# changes almost nothing.
#
# And it is not free. `-ss` before `-i` rebases the input's clock, so the
# trim has to measure from wherever the first frame after the seek landed
# -- which is usually exact and is not always. Across a whole film, two
# of six pieces came back about one AAC frame out (19ms, and 29ms on the
# other film tested), with the local correlation against the unseeked
# build falling to 0.26 in the middle of loud speech while the rest of
# the film sat at 1.000. `-copyts`, which should have made `atrim` immune
# by keeping the original timestamps, did not fix it.
#
# 19ms is a quarter of a frame at 24fps and is audible on a face. That is
# the exact failure this file and spec.frames_for exist to prevent, and
# it is not buyable for 0.8%.
#
# If this is ever worth revisiting, the cost is in the two places named
# above, not here: the sidechain trigger runs the full denoise ->
# normalise -> gate chain when all it has to know is WHEN somebody is
# talking. That is 34.7%, and unlike this it does not move anything.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Giving each piece a second of lead-in to settle on: tried, measured,
# did not work.
#
# The reasoning was sound as far as it went. Every filter in the chain
# carries state and two start in the worst place for a splice --
# speechnorm is an expander that has not heard the voice yet, and agate
# starts OPEN and takes its release to shut -- so each piece begins with
# the room lifted as far as it goes and nothing gating it away. One take
# kept whole has one of those, under the opening music fade. The same
# take cut at its 34 pauses has 35, one on every join.
#
# The lead-in fixed the gate and broke the expander. The audio before a
# piece is the pause that was cut, so it is room tone -- and feeding an
# expander a second of room tone is asking it to open further, not to
# settle. Measured on a real film, room-tone step at the joins:
#
#     before      median 11.5dB, 90th pct 21.6dB, worst 36.4dB
#     with lead   median 10.5dB, 90th pct 19.3dB, worst 23.6dB
#
# A decibel. The two effects cancelled.
#
# The fault is not the cold start, it is that the voice chain runs once
# PER PIECE at all: 35 independent gain trajectories over one continuous
# recording. The fix is to run it once per TAKE and cut the result --
# which also removes the 55% of this file's cost that the -ss note above
# measured, since the expensive filters would run once instead of twice
# per piece. That is a bigger change than this comment.


# Where a spoken take is brought to before anything else touches it.
#
# -20 LUFS because that is what KEY_LEVEL_DB already assumes a speaking
# voice is, and what the gate threshold was tuned against. Those two
# numbers were documented as things speechnorm "brings the voice to

    This used to run per spoken piece, inside speech_chain, and that is
    what put a burst of noise on every join. Each piece was its own
    stream, so each one started these filters cold:

      speechnorm  is an expander. On a fresh stream it has not heard the
                  voice yet and opens at full gain -- on a piece that
                  begins in a pause, that is the room lifted as far as it
                  will go. The note on SPEECH_NORM already has a name for
                  the sound: "a waterfall between the sentences".
      agate       starts OPEN and takes its release, 250ms, to shut. So
                  the waterfall was not gated away; it was let through.
      afftdn      tracks the noise floor, and has to find it again from
                  nothing every time.

    One take kept whole has one such burst, at the very start, under the
    opening music fade, where nobody notices. The same take cut at its 34
    pauses has 35 of them, one on every cut. Measured on a real film, the
    step in room-tone level across a join: median 11.5dB, worst 36.4dB.

    Giving each piece a second of lead-in to settle on was tried first and
    is worth one decibel -- the audio before a piece is the pause that was
    cut, so it is room tone, and feeding an expander room tone asks it to
    open further. It fixed the gate and broke the expander.

    So the take is voiced once, whole, and the pieces are cut out of the
    result. One continuous gain trajectory over one continuous recording,
    which is what it always should have been: the recording IS continuous,
    and only the picture was cut.

    `speed` is applied here, ahead of the normaliser, for the reason
    speech_chain always did it in that order -- so the normaliser's rise
    and fall are measured against the timeline you will actually hear.
    Which means the voiced take is on the SPED timeline, and a moment at
    `t` in the recording is at `t / speed` in it. See place_chain.

    `tuning` is this take's own three numbers -- see tuning_for. The
    gain is the reason the two thresholds are allowed to be levels at
    all, and the thresholds are derived from the same measurement as the
    gain, so all three move together when the material does.
