"""
The layers of ffilm, and the rule that keeps them layers.

A module may import only from a LOWER layer. Foundations know nothing
about stages, stages know nothing about the ways in. That is what lets a
reader understand spec.py without reading cli.py, and what lets a change
to the command line never break the renderer.

Today's violations are listed in KNOWN_EXCEPTIONS, each with the reason.
The list may only shrink: a new violation fails, and so does an entry
that has been fixed but not removed. The day it is empty, the package can
be split into folders along these lines without a single surprise.

Reads the source with `ast` -- nothing is imported, nothing runs.
