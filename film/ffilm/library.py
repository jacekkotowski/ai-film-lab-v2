library.py  --  the shelf. Things you set up once and never think about again.

A film needs two pieces that are almost never about *this* film: a piece
of background music, and a picture to put the title on. Before this, both
had to be carried into every new project folder by hand -- which meant
that the fastest possible film (talk at the camera, watch it back) still
had two trips through Explorer in the middle of it.

So they live once, here:

    library/
      music/    any audio file. Backs every film that has none of its own.
      cover/    backdrops for the thumbnail. Put in two -- one wide, one
                tall -- and each film takes the one that is its shape.

Nothing in here is ever modified, moved or rendered into a film's folder;
it is read where it lies. A project's own `music/` and `cover/` still
win, so one film wanting its own track stays a matter of dropping the
track in that film's folder.

FFILM_LIBRARY moves the shelf somewhere else -- a synced folder, another
drive. Setting it to nothing at all switches the shelf off, which is what
the tests do so that they do not depend on what is on your disk.

README = r"""This folder is your shelf. It is read by EVERY film you make,
so you only have to fill it in once.

  music\   Put a piece of music here -- one file. Every film that does
           not have its own music\ folder uses it: cut to length, faded
           in and out, and turned down while you are talking.

  cover\   Put in two pictures: one WIDE (landscape) and one TALL
           (portrait). When a film needs a thumbnail it takes whichever
           of the two is its shape and prints the film's title on it.
           A .jpg, a .png or a .gif all work.

Several files in either folder is fine -- the first one alphabetically is
used, so putting 01_ in front of a name chooses between them.

To use something different for ONE film, put it in that film's own
music\ or cover\ folder instead. The film's own folder always wins.

Nothing here is ever moved, changed or copied. It is read where it lies.
