"""
kinds.py  --  what counts as a photo, a clip, a track.

One list, imported everywhere. It used to be five: the audio extensions
alone were written out in guide.py, scaffold.py, voice.py and inline in
cli.py, which is exactly the shape of bug that hurts most here -- add
.opus one day, fix three of the four, and a file quietly does not appear
in someone's film with nothing on screen to say why.

Adding a format is now one line in this file.
