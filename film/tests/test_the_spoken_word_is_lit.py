"""
The word being said is the word that is lit.

The speech model has always known when each word starts -- voice.py asks
it for exactly that -- and then threw the times away once the words were
grouped into lines. A caption that lights each word as it is spoken is
read WITH the voice instead of ahead of it, which is most of what makes
a Short captioned this way easy to follow with the sound off.

So each caption keeps `words:` -- when each word starts, in seconds from
the caption's own start -- and the renderer lights the one being said.
Delete the `words:` line and that caption goes back to plain white.
