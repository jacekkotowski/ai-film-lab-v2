"""
cover.py  --  the miniature. The still that makes somebody press play.

The cover proper is not in the film: no duration, no shot, no place on
the timeline -- a picture you upload next to the finished mp4. That is
the whole reason it gets its own folder: an image dropped in `media/`
would be found by `ingest` and dutifully turned into a three-second shot
in the middle of your film. `cover/` is not scanned by anything, so
nothing can happen to it by accident.

The one thing here that IS in the film is the opening card (`build_card`
and below) -- the same picture with the same words, written into
analysis/ so that film.yaml can point at it as an ordinary still. It is
still not made from `cover/` by accident: it is made because a shot in
film.yaml asks for it, and you can delete that shot.

There are two folders it may come from. This film's own `cover/` is for
a picture chosen FOR this film. `library/cover/` is the shelf -- one
landscape picture and one portrait one, filled in once, used by every
film you will ever make, and the picture taken is whichever of the two
is the film's shape.

Neither of them names the film. The title is what the FOLDER is called,
unless film.yaml says otherwise -- see title_from for what happened when
the picture's filename had a say.

Deliberately thin. The type is drawn by `render.draw_captions` -- the
same font, the same shadow, the same wrapping as the words in the film
itself, because a cover set in a different face than the thing it
introduces looks like somebody else made it.

    uv run film cover                       the film's name on the shelf picture
    uv run film cover --title "Kolobrzeg"   or say the words here
    uv run film cover --wide                16:9 instead of the film's shape

`film final` builds one on its own when there is a picture to build it
on, so in the ordinary case this command is never typed at all.
