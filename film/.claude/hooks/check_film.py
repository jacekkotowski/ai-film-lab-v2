"""
check_film.py  --  every edit to a film.yaml is checked the moment it lands.

CLAUDE.md used to say "run `uv run film check` afterwards, always". An
instruction that must happen *every* time is exactly the kind a model
eventually skips, so this runs it instead: AFTER each Edit / Write, if
the file was projects/<film>/film.yaml, it runs `film check` on that film
and hands the output back to Claude.

  - check fails (bad YAML, a missing file)  -> exit 2: Claude is told to
                                               fix it before doing anything else
  - check passes                            -> its report (unused media,
                                               framing warnings) is added to
                                               Claude's context

Wired up in .claude/settings.json as a PostToolUse hook. Standard library
only.
