"""
caption_fit.py  --  place transcript lines onto the shots they were said over.

Two cases, because there are two kinds of source audio:

Global track (a `voiceover.*` file, or any standalone audio file) plays
under the whole film from the start. Its timeline and the film's overall
timeline are the same clock, so placing a line is just: which shot
covers this moment in the finished film?

Per-clip track (audio pulled out of one of your .mp4 clips) has its own
clock -- the clip's OWN original timeline, before you trimmed it with
`in:`/`out:`. A line at 0:42 in the source video only matters to shots
that (a) use that exact clip and (b) whose `in:`/`out:` window actually
contains 0:42. Everything else in the film is irrelevant to that line.
