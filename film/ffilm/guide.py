    uv run film

That one command, with nothing after it, is the whole interface if you
want it to be. It looks at your project, works out which step is missing,
tells you the command in full, and offers to run it for you. Say yes
enough times and you have a film.

It always PRINTS the command before running it. That is deliberate --
after a few films you will know them, and then you can stop asking and
type them yourself. The guide is training wheels that show you the road.

Every other command ends by calling `print_next()` from here, so wherever
you are, the next step is on screen without you having to come back and
ask for it.
