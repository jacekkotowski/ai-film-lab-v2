"""
moves.py  --  the movement vocabulary.

This is the file that decides whether the output looks like cinema or like
a school slideshow. Two ideas do most of the work:

1. EASING. A camera that starts and stops abruptly reads as a machine.
   Real camera moves accelerate and decelerate. Linear interpolation is
   the single most common reason Ken Burns looks cheap.

2. NEVER COMPLETING THE MOVE. We cut while the camera is still travelling.
   A move that visibly finishes and then holds is a slideshow. The
   `settle` parameter below controls how much of the move we actually
   show -- 0.85 means we stop 15% short, so it still feels alive at the cut.

Everything here is deliberately small and tweakable. If a move feels wrong,
the fix is almost always a number in this file, not new code.
