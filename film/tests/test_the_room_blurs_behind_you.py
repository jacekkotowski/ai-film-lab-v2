"""
Bokeh -- the room behind you blurs, and you stay sharp.

Not `fill: blur`, which blurs a copy of the WHOLE picture around it. This
keeps the frame as it is and softens only what is not the person, using a
small segmentation model that is fetched once into models/ and never
committed (see models/README.md).

Measured before it was built, on "I love you" (240 frames at 1:00):
MediaPipe's landscape selfie model 10.8 ms a frame, and it blurred the
door and the hanger that PP-HumanSeg took for a second person.
