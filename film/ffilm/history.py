"""
history.py  --  a quiet undo for film.yaml.

Every render commits the film.yaml it is about to render, if it changed
since the last one. That is the whole feature. It exists because the loop
this toolkit is built around -- watch it, react, change a number, watch it
again -- is only safe if you can get the last number back.

Two rules keep it out of your way:

  1. It commits exactly one path, the project's film.yaml. Whatever else
     you have staged or half-finished is never swept into the commit.
  2. It never fails loudly. No git, not a repository, git having a bad
     day -- every function here shrugs and returns None. A snapshot is
     not worth losing a render over.

To see the history of one film, and to get an old version back:

    git log --oneline -- projects/morning/film.yaml
    git show <sha>:projects/morning/film.yaml > projects/morning/film.yaml
