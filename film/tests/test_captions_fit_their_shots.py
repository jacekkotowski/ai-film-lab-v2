"""
A caption that runs past the end of its shot.

This used to refuse the whole film. Not warn -- refuse: `film peek` on a
thirty-six second film stopped dead because one subtitle was 0.058
seconds too long, which is one and a half frames, which is nothing you
could see. The overrun had been put there by the toolkit's own rounding,
in three different places.

So there are two halves here. Nothing may WRITE a caption that overruns;
and if one turns up anyway -- hand-typed, or from a version of this
toolkit that had the bug -- it is trimmed to fit and the film renders.
