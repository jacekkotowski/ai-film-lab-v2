"""
Every picture shows its own words while you talk -- the words you pasted
in the window, one paragraph per picture, in the film's order.

Found 2026-09-19 on German Forgotten Bauhaus Hope: eight paragraphs
pasted into the narration window for ten pictures, and while recording
there was no text at all. The pictures were paired with the words once,
before the window opened -- with narration.txt, which was empty. What
was pasted never reached them.

Eight paragraphs for ten pictures also needs a way to say which two get
none: `-` on its own is a picture with no words, and `[5]` jumps to
picture 5 and carries on from there, 6, 7...
