# Plan for 2026-09-17: photos and clips together, and a voice over them

Written by Claude (Fable 5.1) on the evening of 2026-09-16, after
yesterday's plan was executed (`docs/plans/2026-09-16/PLAN.md`). Same
rules: the `change-the-machine` skill, a test named as a sentence first,
one item per commit, measure before claiming. **P** is the producer,
**D** the developer.

## Status, end of 2026-09-17

Run autonomously (scheduled task), on the scratch project only -- no
real project under `projects/` was touched. Whole suite green after
every commit (`uv run --extra dev pytest -q`, exit code checked, not
piped through `tail`).

| item | state | commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Two failure modes said out loud | done | dadab02 |
| 2. Narration waits for the opening card | done | a175760 |
| 3. Photographs stretch to cover a narration (first half) | done; second half (cut at the narration's breaths) not started | 35a0bad |
| 4a. `record.take_name`/`next_take_path` (+ a wav-codec bug this surfaced) | done | 80b7313 |
| 4b. `voice.voice_sources` matches a dated voiceover | done | d0c6900 |
| 4c. `film record --voice` | done, but the booth window with no camera is unverified -- see "Needs Jacek" | 380287c |
| 4d. The guide offers and folds in a voiceover | done | f64e01e |
| 5. The other material, tested as material | done (investigation + write-up, no code) | 88a7a24 |

**Needs Jacek**

- **Does the booth window open cleanly with no camera?** `film record
  --voice -p <any project>` once, and watch what the window does. This
  session could not check it: the hard limits forbid running `film
  record` for real (it opens the camera and the microphone). Reasoned
  from `booth.Take._read_frames` (reads an empty stdout pipe and exits
  its thread quietly when there is no `[pw]` video mapping) that it
  should not crash, but reasoning is not the same as watching it. If
  it does not open cleanly, run with `--no-window` instead -- the flag
  is `--no-window`, not `--headless` as an earlier note in this plan
  said; that was this plan's own mistake, corrected here.
- **Muted or at music level, for a clip with no speech?** Item 5 found
  that today's code cannot yet do either cleanly -- `keep_clip_audio`
  runs every clip's audio through the full speech-lift chain regardless
  of whether it has speech in it. The choice, and the small change to
  thread `scaffold.is_talking` into `audio.build_soundtrack`, waits on
  your answer. See item 5 below for the reasoning and the numbers that
  exist without a test file.
- **Watch the peeks**, if you want to see rather than take numbers on
  trust: the vertical scratch render is described under item 5 below
  (not saved anywhere persistent -- it was in the scratch folder outside
  the repo, rebuilt several times over the session).

## What is true tonight

**Measured.** Every one of the 16 projects on this machine is one
talking clip: no photographs, no separate audio, no AI-made intro. So
the photo path, the mixed path and the voiceover path have never been
exercised on a real film, only in the unit tests.

**Measured, tonight, on a scratch project** (`mixed_project.py`: three
photos, a 12 s clip with speech, a 14 s `voiceover.wav`): `ingest`,
`init`, `check`, `caption` and `peek` all ran without an error. So the
chain is not broken. What it does is the question:

| what happened | where | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `init` found `voiceover.wav`, wrote `audio:` and `audio_offset: 0.0` | scaffold.build | works as documented |
| the narration starts at 0.0, under the 4 s title card | `audio_offset` | wrong default: the card is silent by design |
| photos got 4.5 s (5.5 s with a face), the narration's sentences are longer; `caption` said "cut short, the shot ends first" | scaffold STILL_SECONDS, caption_fit | the photos do not know about the narration |
| the film is 27.4 s; the narration is 14 s and the clip's own speech runs from 18 s | audio.build_soundtrack | fine here; see the next row |
| a narration LONGER than the pictures is cut at the film's end by `apad,atrim=0:total` (audio.py, the last filter) with **no message** | audio.build_soundtrack | the failure mode to design against |
| the note in render.py about "the voiceover is shorter than the video" cannot fire any more: sound is a second pass, `stopped_early` no longer happens for audio | render.render | dead text; misleading |
| both the narration and the clip's own talking are mixed, at the same level | audio | right for B-roll with room sound; wrong if you talk in both |
| `ingest` ignores the .wav ("not photos or clips") and says so | ingest | correct |

**Read, not run.** `film record` already supports a microphone with no
camera (`record_command(video=None, ...)` maps `0:a`), and `cmd_record`
prints `Camera: (none)`. Whether the recording window (`booth.py`)
opens with no picture is **not verified**. A mic-only take would be
named `rec_*.mp4` by `take_name`, which `ingest` would then try to read
as a clip. `voice_sources` matches the name `voiceover.` exactly, so
`voiceover_20260917.wav` would fall to "any standalone audio" and print
the note about music.

## The shape of it, so nothing explodes

Nothing new is invented. A voiceover is already a thing the film knows
(`audio:`), the recording window already exists, the pause finder
already exists, `fit_to_target` already scales photographs. Tomorrow
connects them, in the places a user already looks:

- The walk-through gets **one** new alternative, in the slot where
  "say it to the camera" already sits: *"...or say the words over these
  pictures"*, offered when a film has photographs and no narration.
- `film record` gets **one** flag, `--voice`, meaning microphone only.
  Same window, same scrolling script, same ENTER and SPACE.
- `film init` does what it already does, with the narration's length
  and pauses as one more input.
- No new module. No new film.yaml field. No new dependency.

## Items, in order

### 1. Two failure modes said out loud (smallest, first)

- **A narration longer than the pictures.** `checks.py`: when
  `film.audio` is set, compare its length (`audio._dur`) to
  `film.duration`; `film check` and the render say
  `-- 41 s of narration under a 27 s film: the last 14 s will not be
  heard. Hold the photographs longer, or film go --target 41`.
  Pure `narration_note(audio_seconds, film_seconds) -> str | None`,
  test `test_a_narration_longer_than_the_film_is_said_before_the_render`.
- **Delete the dead note in `render.render`** about the voiceover being
  shorter, and its `stopped_early and film.audio` branch. Test: none
  needed; the suite stays green.

**P:** silence at the end of what you recorded, with no word about it,
is the worst outcome on the list. **D:** two functions, one deletion.

### 2. The narration starts after the title card

`scaffold.build` writes `audio_offset: 0.0`. When it also writes the
title card block, write `audio_offset: <card seconds>` instead, with a
comment: `# the narration waits for the opening card`. Pure: `build`
is already testable (`tests/test_title_card.py` reads its output).
Test `test_the_narration_waits_for_the_opening_card`. One line.

### 3. Photographs follow the narration

This is the item that makes a voiceover film watchable, and it is the
inverse of something already built. `scaffold.fit_to_target` shortens
photographs to hit a target and never touches speech. Add the other
direction: when `audio:` is set and the narration is longer than the
pictures, **stretch the photographs** so the film covers the narration
(plus the card, plus `music_fade`). Same function, a target that can
be larger than the sum. Clips are never stretched.

Then the better cut, if there is time: cut the photographs **where the
narration pauses**. `ingest` already finds the pauses in a clip's sound
(`sound_of`, the `quiet` list, `QUIET_FRACTION`); run the same measure
on the voiceover file and give each photograph the stretch between two
pauses. Pure `photo_durations(pauses, n_photos, total) -> list[float]`,
test `test_each_photograph_holds_for_one_breath_of_narration`. Keep
FACE_SECONDS as a floor, not a rule.

**P:** a picture that changes on the breath is what an edited film
does; a picture that changes at 4.5 s regardless is a slideshow. **D:**
the first half is ten lines in a function that exists; the second half
is one pure function and one call. Do the first half before the second.

### 4. Record a voiceover from the same window

- `record.take_name(audio_only=True)` -> `voiceover_YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.wav`
  (`REC_PREFIX` stays for takes with a picture). Test
  `test_a_microphone_only_take_is_a_voiceover_not_a_clip`.
- `voice.voice_sources`: match `voiceover` as a prefix, not
  `voiceover.` exactly. Test
  `test_a_dated_voiceover_is_still_the_narration`.
- `cli.cmd_record --voice`: choose no camera, and say so. **Verify by
  running it once** that the booth window opens with no picture; if it
  does not, run it `--headless` (the flag exists) with the level meter
  in the terminal, and say that in the plan rather than build a window.
- `guide._get_material` is the wrong place: it is for an empty project.
  Add the step in `next_steps` where the film has photographs, no clip
  with sound, and no `audio:`: *"...or say the words over these
  pictures"* -> `record --voice`. After the take, the guide's next step
  is `init` again (the manifest is not older than the media, so today it
  would offer `peek`; the check for "narration newer than film.yaml"
  is one `_mtime` comparison). Tests in `test_guide.py`, which already
  builds fake projects.

**P:** this is the whole feature from the user's chair: drop photos in,
press ENTER, talk, press ENTER. **D:** four small changes in four files
that already do most of it.

### 5. The other material, tested as material

Run `mixed_project.py` again with two more files added by hand and
look at the result, not the log:

- an **AI-made intro clip with no speech** (any short mp4 with music
  only): it should be sampled as B-roll, and its sound should not be
  in the mix at the narration's level. Today `keep_clip_audio` mixes
  every clip's sound. Decide, and write it down: a clip with no speech
  in it (ingest's `ratio` under the pause finder's threshold) plays
  under the narration at music level, or is muted. Producer's call;
  D's guess is muted, since its music would fight the library's.
- a **.HEIC photograph** off a phone (there is none on this machine;
  ask Jacek for one or skip and say so).
- a **vertical film** of the same folder (`film new ... ` then
  `film shape --vertical`): photographs crop around their focus point,
  and the wide clip gets `framing_notes`.

Acceptance is a peek Jacek watches, not a number. Write what was seen
into this file.

**Done, 2026-09-17, by the scheduled run.** Numbers only below; the
peeks themselves are for Jacek to watch, not for this session to judge.

- **AI-made intro clip with no speech.** Checked `projects/`, `library/`
  and the repo root: all 16 original clips in every project's `media/`
  are `rec_*.mp4` talking-head takes (confirms the plan's own premise
  from 2026-09-16). No suitable file exists, so none was added, per
  the plan's own instruction to skip rather than fake one.

  The decision asked for anyway, with the numbers that exist without
  one: today `keep_clip_audio` puts EVERY video shot with an audio
  track through `emit("sp")` in `audio.build_soundtrack` -- there is no
  branch on whether ingest's `ratio` cleared `SOUND_FLOOR` (0.03).
  That means the piece is run through `voiced_take`/`speech_chain`:
  `afftdn` denoise, `speechnorm` (p=0.7, e=2), the two noise gates,
  RNNoise, then the EQ in `VOICE_CHARACTER` -- a chain built and
  measured entirely on spoken voice (docs/decisions/0003, 0008). None
  of that is a defined thing to do to music; `speechnorm` treats a
  quiet passage as room tone to be lifted, which is exactly backwards
  for a fade-in.

  So "muted or at music level" is not yet a switch that exists to flip
  -- both options need `is_talking(entry)` (already in scaffold.py, at
  `SOUND_FLOOR`) threaded into `build_soundtrack` so a non-talking
  clip's own audio either (a) skips `emit("sp")` entirely and is muted,
  or (b) is mixed in through the MUSIC path (`MUSIC_TARGET_LUFS`,
  `music_volume`, no speech-lift chain) instead. Reasoned, not
  measured -- there is no file to measure it on. **Still open: Jacek's
  call between the two**, and it is `change-the-machine` work, not
  today's.

- **A .HEIC photograph.** Checked `projects/`, `docs/`, and the repo
  root: none exists on this machine, confirming the 2026-09-16 finding
  again. Skipped.

- **A vertical film of the scratch project.** Done:
  `uv run film ingest/init -p <scratch>` then
  `uv run film shape --vertical -p <scratch>`. Measured:

  | what | before (`film check`, wide) | after (`film shape --vertical`) |
  |---|---|---|
  | resolution | 1920x1080 | 1080x1920 |
  | thumbnail chosen | horizontal.png | vertical.png (shape-matched automatically) |
  | film duration (reported) | 27.4s | 27.4s |

  Vertical `film peek`, measured with ffprobe rather than assumed:
  output 202x360 (peek tier -- keeps the 1080:1920 aspect), 27.5s
  (frame-rounded from the 27.4s film.yaml total, as `spec.frames_for`
  says it should be). No ffmpeg errors.

  `framing_notes` did **not** fire on the wide clip. Read the reason in
  `checks.framing_notes` rather than assume a bug: it only warns when
  the shot's `focus` sits within `EDGE` (0.28) of a side, and this
  take's detected focus is `[0.515, 0.420]` -- close to centre, so the
  crop for a vertical frame loses background on both sides evenly and
  nothing near an edge is cut off. The mechanism itself already has
  its own tests (`tests/test_nothing_goes_missing.py`); this scratch
  clip simply is not the case that trips it. Photographs cropped
  around their own focus points with no error, matching the documented
  behaviour -- watched in numbers (resolution, duration, no ffmpeg
  errors), not by eye, per how this session works.

### 6. Not touched tomorrow

The voice chain (0003, 0008), the music bed (0007), the look, captions
from the clips' own talking, `scaffold`'s ordering rules, and the bench.
If item 3's second half is not done by the end of the day, it waits.

## What "not exploding" means here

- Every item is a change to a function that exists, in a file that
  exists, tested the way that file is already tested.
- The user sees one new line in the walk-through and one new flag.
- A film made before tomorrow renders exactly as it did, because
  nothing changes unless `audio:` is set or `--voice` is typed.
- The scratch project is the test bed; no real project is edited.
