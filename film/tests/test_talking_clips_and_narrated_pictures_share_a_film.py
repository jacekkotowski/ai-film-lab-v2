"""
A film can hold your talking clips AND photographs you narrated.

Measured on 2026-09-18 with a scratch project -- test_story's three
pictures, its narration with Next pressed twice, and one real talking
take from Morning_2026-09-05. One talking clip switched everything
narrated off: `init` required every shot to be a photograph before it
would cut the narration into slides. So the presses were ignored, the
narration went back to one flat track under the whole film, and the
clip's own speech played over the end of it -- both voices at once from
53.2 s to 59.0 s.

A clip already carries its own sound; a slide carries its piece of the
narration. They are the same kind of shot with the sound in a different
file, and `audio.speech_specs` already places both on one timeline. So:
the narration is cut across the PICTURES only, and every clip stays
where the filename order put it, with its own sound. Nobody talks over
anybody.

Pause lists and a few small files. Nothing decodes audio.
