"""
spec.py  --  what a film IS.

Read this file first. Everything else in the toolkit exists to turn the
objects defined here into pixels. If you understand this file, you own
the system.

A film.yaml looks like this:

    fps: 24
    resolution: [1920, 1080]
    audio: media/music.mp3
    fill: crop                 # crop | blur -- see Film.fill below
    bokeh: 0                   # the room behind a speaker blurred -- Film.bokeh
    depth: 0                   # parallax on photographs -- Film.depth
    look:
      grain: 0.3
      vignette: 0.25

    shots:
      - src: media/harbour.jpg
        duration: 6.0
        move: push_in
        focus: [0.42, 0.38]        # normalised x,y of the thing that matters
        ease: sine_in_out
        captions:
          - text: "Kolobrzeg, November"
            at: 1.0
            dur: 2.5

      - src: media/walk.mp4
        in: "00:02:14.5"
        out: "00:02:19.0"
        move: punch_in

      - src: media/harbour.jpg        # a SLIDE: a photograph with a
        voice: media/voiceover.wav    # piece of the narration on it.
        in: "00:02.05"                # in/out are the words' times
        out: "00:18.20"               # inside the voice file

Coordinate conventions, used everywhere:
  cx, cy   centre of the crop window, 0..1 across the SOURCE image
           (0,0 = top-left, 1,1 = bottom-right, 0.5,0.5 = dead centre)
  scale    1.0 = the window fills the frame. 1.3 = zoomed in 30%.
  roll     degrees. Positive = clockwise. Keep it under 1.0 or it looks drunk.
