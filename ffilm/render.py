render.py  --  turning the spec into pixels.

The pipeline for one output frame:

    source image/frame

      -> affine warp through the crop window    (the camera move)
      -> average N sub-frames                   (shutter / motion blur)
      -> downsample from the supersample buffer (clean edges)
      -> grade + vignette + grain               (the look)
      -> captions
      -> raw bytes into ffmpeg's stdin

Three quality tiers, same code path. That matters: what you judge in
`peek` is the same edit you ship in `final`, only smaller.

# Rendering the shots in parallel: built, measured, taken out again.
#
# It is the obvious next thing. Shots are independent -- the camera for
# shot 9 does not depend on shot 8 -- so the film cuts into spans, one
# process each, encoded separately and concatenated without re-encoding.
# It was about sixty lines and it worked: the pieces joined, and with the
# look's randomness seeded per shot instead of per film they were the
# same frames a whole-film render makes.
#
# It is worth nothing. Measured on a real film, two passes each, same
# machine, six cores:
#
#     one process        72.9s, 69.2s      ~305% of 600% CPU
#     six processes      68.3s, 69.9s      ~561% of 600% CPU
#
# Eighty-four percent more processor burned to finish at the same time.
# Capping each worker to one OpenCV thread (they oversubscribe otherwise,
# since warpAffine and the blurs already thread themselves) changed
# nothing; three workers came out slower than one.
#
# The cores are not the limit. `apply_look` walks a 6.2MB frame about
# eight times -- glow, grey, saturate, tone, flicker, vignette, scratch,
# grain -- so a render is memory bandwidth, and six processes cannot
# make more of that than one. The way to make this faster is fewer
# passes over the frame, not more processes walking it.
#
# Left here rather than in a commit message because the next person to
# look at a 43%-in-apply_look profile will have the same idea.
